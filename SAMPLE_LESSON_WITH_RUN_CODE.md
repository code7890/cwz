# Run Your First Python Program

You're about to run your very first Python program.

Here is a simple program that prints `Hello, World!`.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

All you have to do is click the **Run Code** button.

You'll see `Hello, World!` in the Output section.

Awesome—you've just run your very first Python program!

## Variables in Python

Variables are containers for storing data values.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
city = "New York"

print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
print(f"She lives in {city}")
```

Try changing the values and running the code again!

## Math Operations

Python can perform mathematical operations:

```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(f"Sum: {x + y}")
print(f"Difference: {x - y}")
print(f"Product: {x * y}")
print(f"Division: {x / y}")
```

## Loops

Use loops to repeat actions:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Number: {i}")
```

## JavaScript Example

You can also run JavaScript code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
greet("Alice");
greet("Bob");
```

## Java Example

Here's a Java program:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello from Java!");
        
        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (x + y));
    }
}
```

## C++ Example

And a C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello from C++!" << endl;
    
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    cout << "Sum: " << (x + y) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
